UOW MATH235 Project: Primitive Roots and the Discrete Logarithm Problem

This code forms a small part of a mathematics project that investigates algorithms for solving the discrete logarithm problem.

This repository includes simple implementations of the baby-steps giant-steps algorithm and Pollard's lambda (kangaroo) algorithm.
